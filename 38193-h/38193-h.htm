<h1>The New Royal Cook Book</h1><br>
<p>The new Royal Cook Book has
been prepared to meet the large
and ever increasing demand
for a guide to wholesome and palatable
home cooking. The young housewife
will find here complete simple directions
for making delicious cakes and
other culinary delights. Experienced
cooks and those more skilled in the art
will find here many of their favorite recipes
and in addition helpful suggestions,
especially in the matter of saving eggs
and other expensive materials.</p>

<p><i><b>Every recipe has been tested
many times and all have been
found excellent.</b></i></p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder is used in all
recipes in which a leavening agent is required,
and the biscuits, muffins, griddle
cakes, doughnuts, cakes and pastry prepared
by its use are unequalled in texture
and healthfulness. "Royal" imparts a fine
appearance, and a particularly good
flavor to the food.</p>

<p>Housekeepers are urged to avoid substitutes
for Royal Baking Powder. Failures
in baking often result from the use
of sour milk and soda, or even home
made mixtures of cream of tartar and
soda, because of inability to determine
the uncertain strength of such materials
and hence the proper proportions to use.</p>

<p><i><b>Avoid all guess work by using
"Royal." It is always the same,
always dependable.</b></i></p>

<h2>SOME SECRETS OF GOOD COOKING</h2>


<p>The addition of one or two teaspoons of Royal
Baking Powder to plain pastry will add wonderfully
to its qualities, making it very light and tender.</p>

<p><i>Omelets</i> are improved by the addition of a small
amount of Royal Baking Powder.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder may be added with great
advantage to <i>bread pudding</i>, <i>poultry dressing</i>,
<i>stuffed</i> or <i>deviled crabs</i> and other preparations in
which broken bread or bread crumbs are used.</p>

<p><i>Icings</i> and especially Ornamental Icings are improved
in texture and flavor by the addition of about
a teaspoon of Royal Baking Powder.</p>

<p>Instead of adding soda to keep color in green
vegetables use Royal Baking Powder.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>
<h2>Royal Baking Powder</h2>


<p>For raising or leavening breads, biscuits, rolls, muffins, griddle
cakes, doughnuts, cakes, pastries, puddings and other
similar foods.</p><br>


<p><b>Absolutely Pure and Wholesome</b></p>

<p>The principal active ingredient of Royal Baking Powder is
Royal Grape Cream of Tartar, a derivative of rich, ripe
grapes. It perfectly aerates and leavens the batter or dough
and makes the food finer in appearance, more delicious to
the taste, and more healthful.</p>

<p>It possesses the greatest practicable leavening strength, never
varies in quality, and will keep fresh and perfect in all
climates until used.</p><br>


<p><b>The Standard for over 50 Years</b></p>

<p>For over 50 years Royal Baking Powder has been the standard.
Most of the famous baking recipes in use today were
created with it. Most of the famous cooking schools use it.
Housewives all over the world have followed the lead of
the American housewife and insist upon it. "I must have
La Royal," say our Spanish-speaking neighbors in Mexico,
Cuba and South America. "I want Royal Baking Powder
and no other," say housewives in England, Scotland and
Ireland.</p>

<p>Only unequalled quality could create such a world-wide
demand.</p><br>


<p><b>Used in Leading Hotels</b></p>

<p>Prominent chefs and expert bakers in America, including
those of the famous restaurants in New York, Chicago, San
Francisco and other cities, consider Royal Baking Powder
the most reliable, most efficient and the most dependable
leavening agent.</p>

<p>Physicians recommend Royal Baking Powder for its wholesomeness
and for the healthful qualities that it adds to the
food.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<p><i>For Making the Finest and Most Healthful Food, Royal
Baking Powder is Indispensable.</i></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span></p>
<h2>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<p>Where shortening is mentioned in the recipes it is understood
that butter or lard, or an equivalent quantity of
butter substitute or vegetable oil may be used.</p>


<h3>MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p>All measurements for all materials called for in the
recipes in this book are level.</p>

<p>The standard measuring cup holds one-half pint and is
divided into fourths and thirds.</p>

<p>To make level measurements fill cup or spoon and
scrape off excess with back of knife.</p>

<p>One-half spoon is measured lengthwise of spoon.</p>

<p>Sift flour before measuring.</p>


<h3>BAKING</h3>

<p>Regulate the oven carefully before mixing the ingredients.
Many a cake otherwise perfectly prepared is spoiled
because the oven is too hot or not hot enough.</p>

<p>Biscuits and pastry require a hot oven; cakes, a moderate
oven.</p>

<p>When a cake is thoroughly baked it shrinks from the
sides of the pan. A light touch with the finger which leaves
no mark is another indication that the cake is baked.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt and a little Royal
Baking Powder make pastry light,
flaky and more digestible.</p>

<p>Pastry should rise in baking to double

The novice must learn to handle it lightly
and as little as possible in rolling and
turning. It is important to have all materials
and utensils cold.</p>

<h2><a name="Meats" id="Meats"></a>Meats</h2>


<h3>Roasting</h3>

<p>Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim
and tie into shape if necessary. Put
some pieces of fat in bottom of pan,
and season meat with salt and pepper.
Have oven very hot at first and when
meat is half done reduce heat. Baste
every 10 to 15 minutes. If there is
danger of fat in pan being scorched add
a little boiling water. Roast from 10
to 15 minutes for each pound of meat,
as it is desired rare or well done.</p>


<h3>Broiling</h3>

<p>The rules for roasting meat apply to
broiling, except that instead of cooking
it in the oven it is to be quickly browned,
first on one side and then on the other,
over hot coals or directly under a gas
flame, turning every minute until done.
Meat an inch and one-half thick will
broil in 8 to 15 minutes. Season after
it is cooked.</p>


<h3>Pan Broiling or Frying</h3>

<p>Put meat to be broiled or fried in very
hot frying pan, with very little or no
fat. Turn every few minutes until
cooked. Season and serve immediately.
Steaks and chops may be pan-broiled
without any fat in the pan. For thin
gravy pour a little boiling water into
pan after meat is taken out.</p>


<h3><a name="Boiling_and_Stewing" id="Boiling_and_Stewing"></a>Boiling and Stewing</h3>

<p>Fresh meat for boiling should be put
into boiling water and boiled hard for
about 5 minutes; reduce heat and boil
gently about 20 minutes for each pound,
salt and spices may be added for seasoning.
A little vinegar put into the water
with tough meat makes it tender. The
broth of boiled meat should always be
saved for soups, stews or gravies. Salt
meats should be put in cold water, which
as soon as it boils should be replaced
by fresh cold water, repeating if necessary
until meat has palatable flavor
when done. Salted and smoked meats
require about 30 minutes slow boiling, to
each pound. Vegetables and herbs may
be boiled with them to flavor. When
cooked keep hot until required, if they
are to be served hot; if they are to be
served cold, cool in liquor in which they
were boiled. Very salt meats, or those
much dried in smoking, should be soaked
over night in cold water.</p>


<h3><a name="Pot_Roasting" id="Pot_Roasting"></a>Pot Roasting</h3>

<h3>How to Clean</h3>

<p>Singe fowl over free flame. Cut off
head just below bill. Untie feet,
break bone and loosen sinews just below
joint; pull out sinews and cut off feet.
Cut out oil sac. Lay breast down, make
small slit from backbone toward head;
loosen windpipe and crop and pull out.
Push back skin from neck and cut off
neck close to body. Make slit below end
of breastbone, put in fingers, loosen intestines
from backbone, take firm grasp
of gizzard and draw all out. Cut around
vent so that intestines are unbroken. Remove
heart, lungs and kidneys, wash inside
and out with cold water, then wipe
dry with cloth. Cut through thick fleshy
part of gizzard and remove inside heavy
skin without breaking, then cut away
gristly part so that only thick fleshy part
is used.</p>


<h3>Roast Poultry</h3>

<p>After poultry is cleaned and washed
inside and out with cold water, fill inside
with dressing. Have at least a yard
fine twine in trussing needle. Turn
wings across back so that pinions touch.
Run needle through thick part of wing
under bone, through body and wing on
other side; return in same way, but
passing needle in over bone, tie firmly,
leaving several inches of twine. Press
legs up against body, run needle through
thigh, body and second thigh, return,
going round bone in same way; tie
firmly. Run needle through ends of
legs, return, passing needle through
rump; if opening is badly torn, one or
two stitches may be needed; if steel
skewers are used put one through wings
of fowl and other through opposite
thigh. Then wind twine in figure eight
from one handle of skewer to other.
Rub all over with soft butter and season.

<h3>How to Make Coffee</h3>

<p>The best method of making coffee,
as determined by the Better Coffee-Making
Committee of the National Association
of Coffee Roasters, is as follows:</p>

<p>"Fill a kettle with fresh cold water
and put it on to boil. Place over an open
china teapot, kept just for coffee, a clean,
wet, old linen napkin, or a new square of
unbleached muslin, letting it sag toward
the center. Put into the depression 4
heaping tablespoons (for 4 cups of coffee)
of finely pulverized coffee. This fine
pulverization is very important. Ordinary
ground coffee will not do at all, and
gives weak infusions.</p>

<p>"When the water in the kettle is boiling
fiercely, pour it through the coffee
slowly until 4 cups have gone through,
or a trifle more for 4 cups of coffee.</p>

<p>"Cover and take at once to table.</p>

<p>"Wash the cloth immediately and keep
it in a jar of cold water, never permitting
it to get dry, and freshening the water
every day. Keeping the cloth sweet is
essential. Every effort should be made
to this end. The least souring ruins the
coffee.</p>

<p>"Follow these directions strictly, paying
especial attention to having the coffee
very fine, like flour, and the water
boiling, and you will have excellent coffee
even though you buy cheap blends."</p>


<h3>Boiled Coffee</h3>

<p>For 4 cups. Beat half an egg white
with 3 tablespoons cold water; add 3/4
cup ground coffee and stir until moistened;
put into scalded coffee pot; add
1 quart boiling water and boil 5 minutes.
Add 1/4 cup cold water and allow
to stand 3 minutes to settle and serve.</p>


<h3><a name="Cocoa" id="Cocoa"></a>Cocoa</h3>

<p>The usual rule is 2 teaspoons cocoa, 1
teaspoon sugar; 1 tablespoon cold water
and 3/4 cup milk to each cup. Mix cocoa
with sugar and cold water; cook over
slow fire until thick; add milk, and boil
1 minute.</p>


<h3>Cocoa Syrup</h3>

<blockquote>
2 cups water<br>
2 cups sugar<br>
1 cup cocoa<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt
</blockquote>

<p>Stir water and sugar in saucepan until
dissolved; boil 5 minutes; mix cocoa
with cold water to make a paste and
add to boiling syrup; boil slowly for 10
minutes; add salt. When cold put into
bottle or glass jar in refrigerator. Take
2 tablespoons of syrup for each glass or
cup of milk. Serve with whipped cream.</p>

<p>Served either hot or iced, this is a
nourishing and delicious beverage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<h3>Tea</h3>

<p>Water for tea should be freshly heated
and just boiling. Teas are of different
strength, but a safe rule is 1 teaspoon
dry tea to 1 cup water. Scald teapot;
put in dry tea and cover for 1 minute.
Add boiling water and cover closely.
Allow it to stand 3 to 6 minutes and
strain off into a second hot pot.</p>


<h3>Chocolate</h3>

<p>Cut into small pieces 1 ounce unsweetened
chocolate; add 1 tablespoon
sugar and 2 tablespoons hot water. Boil
all together till smooth; add gradually
2 cups scalded milk; cook in double
boiler 5 minutes. If desired add 1/4 teaspoon
vanilla. Serve with whipped cream.</p>

<h2><a name="Fireless_Cookery" id="Fireless_Cookery"></a>Fireless Cookery</h2>


<p>The Fireless Cooker has become an
important factor in the home. The
principle employed is the preservation
of heat by the use of non-conducting
materials. The device ordinarily used is
a rectangular box lined on all sides
with some substance which will prevent
escape of heat, with spaces or wells for
the insertion of stone or metal discs or
radiators and vessels containing food to
be cooked.</p>

<p>Among the advantages of this method
are: the improvement in flavor by slower
cooking with little opportunity for evaporation;
improved appearance of food
that is subject to shrinkage when
cooked by ordinary methods; saving in
labor, as the cooking practically takes
care of itself. Dinner may be prepared
in the morning, placed in the cooker,
and without further attention be ready
to serve at any time after 3 or 4 hours.
While the time required for cooking is
longer than in the usual methods, the
actual time consumed in preparation of
a meal is considerably reduced.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>

<p>Prepare food for cooking as usual.
Place in special vessel, designed to fit
into wells of Fireless Cooker, and heat
on range or over gas flame until ordinary
cooking temperature is reached. Put
into cooker with one or more radiators
which have been heated for 10 or 15
minutes over hot fire. For roasting,
radiator should be hot enough to brown
a pinch of flour immediately. Close
cover, fasten lightly so that the steam
may escape and allow cooking to proceed
for time specified in recipes.</p>

<p>For baking cake, apples, etc., proceed
as for roasting. The time required for
baking is slightly longer than that specified
for regular ovens. For cake ordinarily
baked in a moderate oven, heat
radiators hot enough to brown a pinch
of flour in half a minute.</p>

<p>The Fireless Cooker is especially convenient
for the preparation of cereals,
meats, vegetables and other dishes that
are ordinarily boiled or roasted. Remember
that foods should be thoroughly
heated before putting into cooker.</p>


<h3><a name="Cereals" id="Cereals"></a>Cereals</h3>

<p>Prepare cereal for cooking in double
boiler as usual. Boil over fire for 5 minutes;
place in larger vessel of boiling
water in cooker and allow it to remain
4 or 5 hours or longer. If placed in
cooker at night it should remain warm
enough to serve for breakfast.</p>


<h3>Steaming</h3>

<p>For recipes see "Boston Brown Bread,"
"Steamed Fig Pudding," "Poor Man's
Pudding," "Christmas Plum Pudding,"
etc. Prepare and mix ingredients as
directed. Put into greased molds and
place in shallow pan of boiling water
over very hot radiator in cooker. Fasten
cover tight and cook for 5 to 6 hours.</p>


<h3><a name="Soupsfl" id="Soupsfl"></a>Soups</h3>

hours and season when ready to serve.</p>

<p>For ingredients and special directions
for preparing soups, see "Soups."</p>


<h3><a name="Roast_Meats" id="Roast_Meats"></a>Roast Meats</h3>

<p>Prepare and season meat in usual way.
Place in large dry vessel; put very hot
radiator in bottom of cooker well; place
vessel containing roast on radiator, and
place another very hot radiator on top.
Close cooker and fasten. Allow it to
remain about one-half hour per pound
of meat.</p>

<p>The roast may be browned in a very
hot oven before putting into cooker or
just before serving.</p>


<h3><a name="Boiled_Meats" id="Boiled_Meats"></a>Boiled or Stewed Meats</h3>

<p>Prepare meat for cooking as usual,
searing in frying pan if desired brown.
Place in large vessel and cover or partly
cover with boiling water, boiling with
cover fastened tight for 10 or 15 minutes
over free flame. Transfer to cooker,
using one hot radiator underneath.
Cook 2 or 3 hours, season and serve.</p>


<h3>Vegetables</h3>

<p>Prepare vegetables as usual. Place in
vessel with small quantity of boiling
water. As there is little evaporation in
fireless cookers, allowance does not have
to be made for loss by evaporation. Boil
over free flame for 5 to 10 minutes.
Transfer to cooker, using one radiator in
bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours, remove
from cooker, season and serve.</p>

<h2><a name="Preserving_and_Canning" id="Preserving_and_Canning"></a>Preserving and Canning</h2>

<p>(Material adapted from U. S. Food Administration
and N. Y. State Department
of Agriculture.)</p>


<h3>General Directions</h3>

<p>Test all jars for leakage before using.
To do this, fill with water, put on rubber
and cover, seal and invert.</p>

<p>Sterilize all utensils, jars, covers, etc.,
by covering with cold water, and boil
for 10 minutes. Use only new rubbers
and dip in boiling water just before using.</p>

<p>Use a wide-mouthed funnel when filling
jars to avoid loss of material and
keep jar rim clean.</p>

<p>Invert all jars after filling and sealing.</p>

<p>Fruit should be sound, firm and not
overripe. All fruit should be carefully
prepared.</p>

<p>Clean fruit, clean hands, clean utensils,
and a clean kitchen free from flies,
are essential for safety and success.</p>

<p>Keep products in a cool place. Avoid
freezing in winter.</p>


<h3>Canning</h3>

<p>Canning is the operation of preparing
sterilized food so that it will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>The custom of canning fruit in syrup
is based on the improvement in flavor
and texture which sugar gives to fruit.
Sugar is not necessary for its preservation.
Success depends upon thorough
sterilization&mdash;that is, killing the organisms
which cause food to spoil, and then
sealing carefully to prevent their entrance.
Fruit may be canned in water,
in fruit juice and in syrup.</p>


<h3>Preserving</h3>

<p>The only difference between preserving
and canning fruit is that sugar is
always used in preserving, while in canning
it is used in smaller quantity or
not at all. In preserving the old rule
of equal weights of sugar and fruit may
be followed.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span></p>


<h3>Directions for Canning by Open-Kettle Method</h3>

<p>By this method which is generally
used, for preserves, jams and marmalades,
food is completely cooked and
poured boiling hot into sterilized jars.</p>

<p>Prepare fruit, which may or may not
be peeled, and cut into pieces depending
on the variety. Blanch or scald peaches
and similar fruits to loosen skin and
chill by plunging into cold water. Cook
slowly in as little water as possible or
in fruit juice or fruit syrup until done.
Fill the sterilized jars, seal and invert.</p>


<h3>Directions for Canning by Can-Cooked Method</h3>

<p>By this method uncooked or partly
cooked food is packed in can or jar,
covered with liquid and both jar and
contents sterilized.</p>

<p>Pare fruit if desired or blanch or scald
in boiling water a small quantity of the
fruit at a time. (See time table.) Do
not blanch cherries, sour cherries excepted,
berries or plums.</p>

<p>Chill outside of the blanched fruit by
immersing it for a few minutes in a vessel
of cold water. Remove skin from
such fruits as peaches.</p>

<p>Pack firmly in clean, tested jars to
within one-half inch of top.</p>

<p>Fill jars to within 1/4 inch of top with
boiling water, fruit juice, or syrup.</p>

<p>Place a new rubber on each jar, adjust
cover and partly seal.</p>

<p>Place jars on false bottom of water
bath and sterilize for required time. (See
time-table.) If the hot-water bath is
used, jars should be immersed in sufficient
boiling water to cover tops to depth
of about 1 inch. Do not begin to time

<h3>Use of Sugar in Canning Fruit</h3>

<p>Sugar is used in canning fruit for the
purpose of improving flavor and is not
necessary for preservation.</p>

<p>Thin syrup&mdash;1 part sugar to 2 parts
water for sweet fruits.</p>

<p>Medium Syrup&mdash;1 part sugar to 1 part
water for berries and medium sweet
fruits.</p>

<p>Thick Syrup&mdash;2 parts sugar to 1 part
water for sour fruits.</p>

<p>To make syrup add sugar to boiling
water. Stir until all sugar is dissolved,
then boil 2 or 3 minutes.</p>


<h3>Canned <a name="Peaches" id="Peaches"></a>Peaches</h3>

<p>Scald sound, firm freestone peaches,
a small number at a time, in boiling water
just long enough to loosen skins;
dip them quickly into cold water and
slip off skins. Cut peaches in halves, and
remove stones. Have ready a syrup
made by boiling sugar and water together
until sugar has dissolved, using
1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar to each cup water.
Allow about 1 cup syrup for each quart
jar of peaches. Put in 1 cracked peach
pit for every quart of syrup.</p>

<p>Can-cooked Method.&mdash;Pack peaches in
overlapping layers with rounded side uppermost
and blossom end facing glass.
Fill each jar with hot syrup and adjust
rubber, cover and upper clamp, thus
partly sealing jar. Place jars on a rack
in hot water to cover tops to a depth
of 1 inch. Bring water to boiling point,
and boil pint jars 16 minutes, quart
jars 20 minutes. Remove jars, seal and
invert to cool.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Open-kettle Method.&mdash;Cook peaches in
syrup until tender; then with sterilized
spoon slip them carefully into sterilized
jar; fill jar to overflowing with syrup.
Adjust rubber, cover, seal immediately,
and invert to cool.</p>


<h3>Canned Cherries</h3>

<p>Wash. Cherries should be pitted before
being canned in order to conserve
space. Can sweet cherries as berries.
Blanch sour cherries 1/2 minute, in boiling
water. Dip in cold water; drain and
pack closely into hot sterilized jars.
Cover with boiling water or boiling
medium syrup. Loosely seal. Sterilize
16 minutes in boiling water bath. Remove
jars at once, tighten covers, invert
to test seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Canned <a name="Pears" id="Pears"></a>Pears</h3>

<p>Wash and peel fruit and follow directions
for canned peaches.</p>


<h3>Canned Berries</h3>

raspberries, loganberries, gooseberries
and strawberries should be canned as
soon as possible after picking. Hull or
stem; place in strainer and wash by
lifting up and down in pan of cold
water.</p>

<p>Pack into hot sterilized glass jars,
using care not to crush fruit. To insure
a close pack, put a 2 or 3 inch layer of
berries on the bottom of jar and press
down gently with spoon. Continue in
this manner until jar is filled. Boiling
water or boiling thin or medium syrup
should be poured over the fruit at once.
Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in
boiling water. Remove jars, tighten
covers, invert to test seal and cool.</p>


<h3><a name="Asparagus48" id="Asparagus48"></a>Asparagus</h3>

<p>Asparagus for canning must be fresh
and tender. Select tips of uniform size
and maturity and wash. Cut into lengths
according to containers to be used.
Scrape off scales, tough outer skins and
hard ends and tie in bundles large enough
for one jar.</p>

<p>Immerse the lower ends in boiling
water and leave them immersed for 5
minutes, then the entire stalks, leaving
them in 1 to 3 minutes longer.</p>

<p>Cold dip, drain, pack neatly, tips up,
in hot sterilized jars. Add salt and
cover with boiling water. Loosely seal,
sterilize two hours in boiling water bath.
Remove as soon as time is up. Tighten
covers, invert to test seal and cool.</p>


<h3><a name="Beans" id="Beans"></a>Beans</h3>

<p>Green String Beans and Wax Beans.&mdash;The
beans should be tender and fresh,
and graded according to size and washed.
Leave whole or break in uniform pieces.
Blanch 5 to 10 minutes until the pod
will bend without breaking. Cold dip,
drain well and pack into hot jars. Add
salt and cover with boiling water.
Loosely seal and sterilize two hours in
boiling water. Remove when time is up,
tighten covers, and invert to test seal.</p>


<h3>Corn</h3>

<p>Make careful selection of tender, juicy
sweet corn, at best stage for table use.
Can as soon as possible after gathering.
Remove husks and silk; blanch
tender ears 5 minutes, older ears 10 minutes.
Cold dip and cut from cob but
not too close. Pack at once into hot
sterilized jars. As corn swells during
sterilization, leave space of 1 inch at
top. Add salt and cover with boiling
water. Be sure that water penetrates
through corn to the bottom of jar. Loosely
seal and sterilize three hours in boiling
water. Remove when time is up,
tighten covers, invert to test seal and
cool.</p>


<h3><a name="Jams" id="Jams"></a>Jams</h3>

<h2>Keep the Home Baking Safeguarded</h2>


<p>Housekeepers who have always used
Royal Baking Powder with utmost satisfaction
are sometimes misled into experimenting
with baking powders containing
questionable ingredients.</p>

<p>No real economy is thus accomplished&mdash;in
fact, the use of an unwholesome,
undependable baking powder often produces
a bitter taste in the food which
makes it unappetizing and sometimes inedible,
to say nothing of the injurious
effect produced upon the digestive
system.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder is most economical.
Its well-known dependability
makes baking success simpler and surer,
thus preventing loss of eggs, flour, butter
and other ingredients. Only the best materials
are used in its production&mdash;pure
cream of tartar and tartaric acid, derived
from grapes, bicarbonate of soda and
corn starch, all scientifically blended and
perfectly balanced. The best is always
the most economical.</p>

<p><i><b>To insure food that is always
delicious, wholesome and appetizing,
insist on using Royal Baking
Powder which is made from Cream
of Tartar, derived from grapes.</b></i></p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2>BAKE IT WITH ROYAL AND BE SURE</h2>


<p>has been the motto for fifty years
in millions of homes where good
food is recognized as the first essential
of good health and where pride
is taken in good baking.</p>

<p>One of the distinctive qualities of
food baked with Royal Baking
Powder is <i>wholesomeness</i>.</p>

<p>This is health insurance of such
vital importance that millions of
women bake at home just to be
sure that Royal Baking Powder
is used.</p>

<p><i>Remember the adage</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bake it with Royal and be sure."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
